# Global-Sales-Analysis-Dashboards
## Project Overview
Dive into a robust data analysis and visualization journey with this project, leveraging the power of Python and Power BI. My mission was to preprocess, transform, and model data, culminating in interactive dashboards that unveil insights into sales performance, regional dynamics, and customer profiles. 
## Project Details
### Data Preprocessing:
#### Python Operations
- Data Extraction: Utilized Python to load and extract relevant data from Excel.

- Initial Cleaning: Performed initial data cleaning and filtering operations using pandas to optimize the dataset for analysis.

- Normalization: Applied Min-Max scaling to normalize the SalesAmount column, ensuring all values are within a comparable range.

- Handling Missing Values: Implemented strategies to handle missing values, such as imputation and removal of incomplete records.
#### Python Operations
- Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to uncover patterns and trends.

- Visualization: Generated various plots and charts using seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the data and highlight key insights.
#### Interactive Dashboards:
- Imported the cleaned data into Power BI and performed further cleaning using Power Query.
- Created a custom DimDate table using DAX to enable time-based analysis.
- Developed interactive dashboards in Power BI to provide dynamic insights into sales performance, regional trends, and customer profiles.
- Established relationships between the fact and dimension tables in a star schema format.
- Ensured optimized model performance for better visualization interactivity.

## Designed Three interactive dashboards:

- Global Sales analysis Overview Dashboard: Highlights overall the turnover by currency, and product performance by color.
- Top selling products: Gives the description of the products with the best five sellers. 
- The Tooltip Dashboard: Provides detailed insights of the target of sales, Total revenue and a comparison of sales and the pourcentage of their growth.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python for data extraction and preprocessing.

- Power BI for data modeling, DAX calculations, and creating visualizations.

- Power Query for advanced data transformations.

## Key Highlights
- Star Schema Implementation: Designed a clean star schema to streamline and optimize data analysis.
- Dynamic Analysis with DAX: Utilized DAX to create calculated columns and measures, enhancing the flexibility and depth of analysis.
- Interactive Dashboards: Developed interactive dashboards that allow for in-depth exploration of sales trends and customer behaviors.
